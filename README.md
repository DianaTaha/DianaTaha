With over 10 years of experience in Digital Marketing Management and CRM modeling, I have a passion for data and pattern identification. Recently, I've honed my expertise in delving deeper into data and insights, translating them into clear, concise reports that drive strategic decision-making. Proficient in tools like Power BI, I specialize in extracting, transforming, analyzing, and visualizing data for business intelligence purposes. I'm continually expanding my knowledge in this area as I embark on a journey to delve even further into the realm of data analytics.
